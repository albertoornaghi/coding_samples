# coding_samples
This repository contains samples from code I have written for my undergraduate dissertation and other research projects. All code is written in STATA and pertains to three differect projects. .do files with the prefix RFE pertain to my dissertation on Radical Flank Effects in the UK's environmental movement, for which I have also included the raw and cleaned data I created from the survey experiment used for this study. .do files with the prefix MN pertain to the anaylsis for a Methods Note published by Afrobarometer which we wrote using the findings from our capstone. This was a collaborative project but I wrote the entirety of the code for it. This last project uses a dataset derived from Afrobarometer's survey data, and hence is not included here.

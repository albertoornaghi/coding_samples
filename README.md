# coding_samples
This repository contains samples from code I have written for my undergraduate dissertation and other research projects. All code is written in STATA and pertains to three differect projects. .do files with the prefix RFE pertain to my dissertation on Radical Flank Effects in the UK's environmental movement, for which I have also included the cleaned dataset I created from the survey experiment used for this study. .do files with the prefix AB pertain to my capstone project on interview duration for Afrobarometer which, although it was a collaborative project, I wrote almost all of the code for it. .do files with the prefix MN pertain to the anaylsis for a Methods Note published by Afrobarometer which we wrote using the findings from our capstone. This was again a collaborative project but, in this case, I wrote the entirity of the code for it. The latter two projects use a dataset derived from Afrobarometer's survey data, and hence is not included here.
